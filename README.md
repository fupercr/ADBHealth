# ADBHealth

Agent Distributed Bus - Healh sector implementation


## Description

This project provides software entities to develop agents with standarized data 
interoperability for the Republic of Costa Rica. The design is inspired in
complex systems theory, distributed systems theory and numerous results from the
literature on carbon emissions in IT.

In addition, we provide a next generation licensing scheme that serves the goals
of emerging economies and developing nations in order to break free fom software
dependencies generated in predatory contracts. FUPER believes that critical
software artifacts for States should remain open and be improved by committed
citizens. All public software should as well account for their own emissions. 


## About the ground truths for the carbon emissions model

The carbon emissions model implemented in ADBHealth is was carefully researched
and computed from long standing literature in IT. The goal of our framework is
to remain nimble not only conceptually, but operationally. We provide tools and
data logging that can be used for counterfactual analysis.


### Ground truths for digital carbon emissions

For our model, we estimate 20mg of CO2 per second per transaction
based on:
- Gombiner, J., 2011. Carbon footprinting the Internet. Consilience:
The Journal of Sustainable Development, 5(1), pp.119-124.

Also, we estimate 80mg of CO2 per second in average per each usage of
telecommunications infrastructure forced by each tramit. Based on:
- Chan, C.A., Gygax, A.F., Wong, E., Leckie, C.A., Nirmalathas, A. and
Kilper, D.C., 2012. Methodologies for assessing the use-phase power
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of telecommunications network
services. Environmental science & technology, 47(1), pp.485-492.
