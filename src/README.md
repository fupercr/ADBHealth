About the ground truths for the carbon emissions model
======================================================


Ground truths for digital carbon emissions
------------------------------------------

For our model, we estimate 20mg of CO2 per second per transaction
based on:

    Gombiner, J., 2011. Carbon footprinting the Internet. Consilience:
    The Journal of Sustainable Development, 5(1), pp.119-124.

Also, we estimate 80mg of CO2 per second in average per each usage of
telecommunications infrastructure forced by each tramit. Based on:

    Chan, C.A., Gygax, A.F., Wong, E., Leckie, C.A., Nirmalathas, A. and
    Kilper, D.C., 2012. Methodologies for assessing the use-phase power
    consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of telecommunications network
    services. Environmental science & technology, 47(1), pp.485-492.
